                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Create an app to allow users to manage complicated crafting projects, by organizing and tracking the
                    various materials, references, and planning that such projects require.</p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>My goal was to design a system that would be flexible enough to work across crafting disciplines,
                    while maintaining clear visibility and an efficient and easy to navigate architecture, in order to
                    minimize the user’s mental load to free them up to concentrate on the fun parts of crafting.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Figma, Zoom, Google Docs, Invision, Google Sheets, Trello</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Comparative Analysis, Feature Cards, Directed Storytelling, Speed Dating, Kano Model, User Journey
                    Map, Wireframes, Interactive Prototype, Usability Testing</p>

                    <h3>MANAGING COMPLICATED PROJECTS</h3>
                    <p>Crafting can be a complicated space to work in - there are many parts of a project that crafters
                        need to keep track of. Whether they’re a hobbyist or make their living selling their work,
                        <b>crafters need to track materials, expenses, references, images, deadlines, events, and plan
                            out their process.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>CREATE AN EFFICIENT HUB</h3>
                    <p>I aimed to create an app that could act as an organizational hub for the crafting process. It
                        should simplify a complicated space into an efficient architecture that would also be flexible
                        enough to accommodate a variety of crafting disciplines - knitting, embroidery, sewing, jewelry,
                        costuming, leather work - whatever craft someone might bring to the table.</p>

                    <h2>Users</h2>
                    <h3>Crafters</h3>
                    <p>The primary user for this app is a hobbyist crafter. My user research in the discovery phase
                        pointed to problems with keeping track of items that were already owned, leading to buying
                        extra, or needing to make another trip for something forgotten. Most of the crafters I
                        interviewed were cosplayers - people who recreate costumes from various media. They needed to
                        keep track of a large number of reference images, and easily lost track of files across the
                        various places they would find or store them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>A VARIETY OF CRAFTING DISCIPLINES</h3>
                    <p>Some crafters specialize in one discipline, but many dabble in at least a couple. Every test
                        participant I interviewed worked with at least three different types of crafts. It was therefore
                        important to me to emphasize flexibility in my design, so that users could have one tool that
                        could work across their disciplines, rather than needing to resort to a separate app for each
                        one.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>DISCOVERY RESEARCH + COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>I began by investigating currently available project management apps and crafting apps in a
                        comparative analysis in order to evaluate existing solutions, and gain insight into common and
                        uncommon features. My scope included systems that were not geared towards crafts, apps that
                        targeted specific craft disciplines (quilting, knitting), and a couple of apps specifically
                        targeting cosplayers. I also included a printable PDF I found on a crafting blog. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAMES + FEATURE CARDS</h3>
                    <p>Using my findings from the comparative analysis, I moved into creating low fidelity wireframes to
                        externalize burgeoning design ideas. I made these into a set of feature cards to use in my first
                        round of user interviews, to get some early insight into specific user needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>DIRECTED STORYTELLING AND A HYBRID SPEED DATING KANO MODEL</h3>
                    <p>My first round of user research were interviews with four participants, with each session lasting
                        about 45 - 60 minutes. I began with some directed storytelling and sensing questions. The second
                        part of each session of was a combination of speed dating with feature cards, and questions
                        using the Kano model. After showing the user a feature card, I asked for their initial
                        impression of the feature, and then asked the two standard Kano model questions - how would you
                        feel if this feature was present, and how would you feel if this feature was note present? I
                        used the responses from the first question to validate or refine designs, and the data from the
                        Kano questions to prioritize which areas of the app to develop first.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>PERSONA, USER JOURNEY MAP, AND SCREEN FLOW</h3>
                    <p>Having now better familiarized myself with my target users, I created a persona card representing
                        the primary users, and a user journey map. The user journey map included multiple touch points
                        ranging from initiating user awareness, to the user sharing their finished project. With a
                        clearer vision of the user and the user’s journey, I moved to creating the architecture strategy
                        for the app. My goal as I designed was to keep the interface clean and simple with uncluttered
                        screens, while balancing a desire to keep the number of clicks to any part of the app to a
                        minimum.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>HIGH FIDELITY WIREFRAMES AND ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
                    <p>I recreated the architecture diagram in Figma with empty frames, and then began filling in the
                        frames with my low fidelity wireframes from the feature cards. I adjusted these as needed, and
                        then began increasing the fidelity. I created the visual design with accessibility in mind -
                        large buttons that a busy person with possibly sore or messy fingers could easily press without
                        accidentally selecting something else. I was also careful to mind contrast ratios for the
                        visually impaired, and checked the hues across various types of color blindness - one of my test
                        participants specifically mentioned her color blind friends, and I wanted to make sure they
                        would find the app as easy to use as anyone else.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Evaluating the High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                    <p>After hooking up all of the wireframes into an interactive prototype in Figma, I conducted three
                        usability test sessions with target users. I directed the users through a series of tasks
                        leading them along a happy path through the app, focusing on the “Projects” tab and its
                        subsequent pages.</p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
                    <p>The usability test results were largely positive. Users were able to easily complete the tasks,
                        and found navigation intuitive. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>STRUGGLE WITH MICROCOPY</h3>
                    <p>The one notable exception is some struggle with the title for the “Elements” section. I tested a
                        few different words, and none quite fit the bill. 2/3 test participants weren’t immediately sure
                        what that section meant, but all were able to eventually figure it out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>There’s a good chunk of the app left to wireframe and add to the prototype. The most pressing is
                        to integrate the shopping list functions into the material list page, and then to flesh out the
                        remaining screens from the architecture diagram and and some in-between screens and things like
                        the settings screen. Once the app fully functions as a tool for an individual, I would like to
                        add framework for community and externalization - exporting project information to a printable
                        PDF, and sharing progress to social media.</p>
