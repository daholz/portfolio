                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Evaluate the TalkAboutDepression.org website's navigation, way-finding, ability to provide information and 
                    advice about depression, and ensure it can be used to reduce the stigma around depression by providing a 
                    space to read and share personal stories.</p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Destigmatize talking about depression by providing learning resources and first-hand accounts of 
                    experiencing depression, in order to help yourself or friends who are experiencing depression or suicidal 
                    thoughts.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Sketch, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Zoom, Keynote, Trello</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Heuristic Analysis, Participant Observation, High Fidelity Wireframes</p>

                    <p>TAD has two groups of primary users. The first are people with depression seeking help and looking 
                        to share and read stories about depression, with the aim of feeling less alone in their struggle.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>FRIENDS OF PEOPLE GOING THROUGH IT</h3>
                    <p>The second primary user group are friends and family of people experiencing mental health problems 
                        or crises. They’re looking for resources to learn about depression, and how to help their loved ones.</p>

                    <h2>Role</h2>
                    <h3>INDEPENDANT RESEARCH AND REPORT</h3>
                    <p>I worked with a small group, but we began by seperately conducting heuristics analysis of the TAD 
                        website. I created a heuristic analysis report to bring back to the group. I also worked alone to 
                        create a high fidelity wireframe showing recommended changes, and a final deliverable research findings and recommendations report.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>GROUP RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>My team worked together to create a participant observation script, and to run the usability tests. 
                        We took turns filling the different roles. I took one turn as a moderator, several turns as the 
                        greeter and tech support, and one turn as a principle observer.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="csContent">
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>HEURISTIC ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Each person on my team developed their own heuristic analysis report to share with the group. 
                        I chose to use Susan Weinschenk and Dean Barker’s 20 Usability Heuristics to examine the website’s 
                        usability. There were many issues that came up, but my hypothesis was that the largest issues were 
                        with simplicity, predictability, linguistic clarity, and fulfillment. I predicted that these areas 
                        would affect not only the site’s utility to users, but also the ability for the organization to 
                        achieve its goals. Going into writing the script for the usability tests as a group, those were areas 
                        that I and my team particularly wanted to probe. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION</h3>
                    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of our participant observation usability tests took place remotely 
                        using Zoom. Five the tests were managed as a group, generally with one moderator, a host/tech 
                        specialist, and two observers/note takers.</p>
                    <p>To get a sense of the users’ familiarity and experience with the topic, we began each test with some 
                        delicate probing contextual questions about depression and mental health resources. We made sure to 
                        warn our participants about the sensitive content at the top of the session, and assured them they 
                        could take a break or end the test at any point - one participant did choose to end their session early.</p>
                    <p>The remaining participants were led through three scenarios exploring the client’s 
                        top goals for their website.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide quick and easy access to support tools for those who have friends experiencing a crisis</li>
                        <li>Provide easy access to reputable information on depression and suicide</li>
                        <li>Facilitate opportunities for ‘social empathy engagement’ or ways in which individuals can learn 
                            about others’ or share their own mental health journey</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>SPEAK WITH A CLEAR VOICE AND PROVIDE ACTIONS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our evaluation dug up a number of trouble areas that needed attention, but two larger themes stuck out. 
                        The organization’s voice wavered in its execution, and while there was plenty of information from 
                        reliable sources, it lacked quick actions and advice for worried users. This led to vaguely worded 
                        menus and confusing navigation, images that weren’t striking the right tone, and unfulfilled or 
                        frustrated users. However, we also found that participants generally responded well to the website’s 
                        goals, sources, color scheme, and visual hierarchy.

                    <h3>HIGHLIGHTING FOUR AREAS OF CONCERN</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose to highlight four particular areas of concern, and my recommendations for addressing them: 
                        Navigation, Getting Help, Readability, and Sharing Stories. I correlated these themes to the client’s 
                        top goals, and the test participants’ difficulties with navigation, and their frustrations with the 
                        kinds of information they were finding vs the kinds of the information they hoped to find. There was a 
                        fair amount of natural overlap between the user and client goals for this project. The stated goal of 
                        the website, to de-stigmatize talking about depression and sharing reliable information about depression 
                        and suicide prevention, resonated with our test users and made it easy to align their needs with the clients 
                        to come up with solutions to suit both.
