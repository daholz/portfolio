                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>MnTech is rebranding with a new focus and energy. They are adding a focus on communities of interest, 
                    and need a multi-touchpoint strategy to encourage participation. 
                    They've also discovered that most eligible members don't know that they're members.</p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Boost awareness of membership status and benefits.
                    Increase membership activity in communities of interest (taking place primarily on their newest 
                    touchpoint, mobilize.io).
                    Encourage sustained engagement in communities of interest..</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Google Docs, Google Sheets, Sketch, Invision</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Stakeholder Interview, Deep Dive, Touchpoint User Journey Map, Storyboard, 
                    Low and High Fidelity Wireframes, Findings and Strategy Presentation</p>

                    <p>
                        Companies sign up and pay for MnTech membership for their tech department employees. Unfortunately, 
                        not all of these eligible members are aware that they’re members, much less aware of the 
                        benefits that entails.

                    <br>
                    <h3>NEW OFFERINGS</h3>
                    <p>MnTech wants to focus on creating a self-sustaining community with active members and continued 
                        participation after capturing more users - people who would sign up for the COIs, but also talk on 
                        the mobilize board, share polls and files, and show up to meet-ups.</p>

                    <p>Many potential users for MnTech are employees of member companies, going about their daily lives, 
                        working their jobs in tech, completely unaware that they have a community and numerous benefits
                         available to them.</p>

                    <h3>ACTIVE MEMBERS</h3>
                    <p>MnTech users are people working in technology, all across Minnesota. Active users are people that 
                        want to further their careers and improve their skills, and to collaborate and share exciting 
                        developments in tech.</p>

                    <h3>PART OF A SMALL TEAM</h3>
                    <p>I worked with a small team of UX designers in this role. We worked together to develop the overall 
                        multi-touchpoint strategy by splitting up the project into different sections of the user journey, 
                        and collaborating together to maintain consistency.</p>

                    <h3>INDEPENDENT WORK</h3>
                    <p>I was responsible for developing the strategy to created sustained activity and participation. 
                        I focused on the mobilize.io platform and email touchpoints for my deep dive research and wireframes. 
                        I also created and narrated that portion of our presentation, in addition to the Persona slide.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>IDENTIFYING TOUCHPOINTS AND A DEEP DIVE</h3>
                    <p>We began the project by talking with the initiator of MnTech’s communities of interest. She gave us 
                        an hour of her time to go over MnTech’s goals, values, history, and hopes. She also explained that 
                        they want to focus on creating a self-sustaining community with active members and continued 
                        participation after capturing more users - people who would sign up for the COIs, but also talk on 
                        the mobilize board, share polls and files, and show up to meet-ups. </p>
                    <p>
                        After the interview, my group divvied up MnTech’s various touchpoints, competitors, and partners 
                        among ourselves and did a deep dive into the context of the problem. I focused on mobilize, and how 
                        we could use it to encourage an active community. I was given access to what they had set up in 
                        mobilize so far, and I scoured the forward-facing mobilize site for how-to videos. I found that 
                        mobilize had limited visual customization, but had a robust communication system using public posts, 
                        private chats, email blasts, and a communal calendar.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>DISTILLING THE USER’S JOURNEY</h3>
                    <p>
                        After debriefing as a group on MnTech’s resources and competition, we moved to creating an ideal user 
                        journey map to lay out our holistic strategy. Our main target user for this strategy was an employee 
                        at a member company, someone who is already a member of MnTech but doesn’t know it yet. Less 
                        importantly, but still pertinent, this would be a person under 45, an under-represented group in 
                        MnTech’s communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With these characteristics in mind, we created a user journey map starting from discovery and 
                        interest, leading into information gathering, joining a COI, and ultimately entering a cycle of participation and reward. This reward could consist of knowledge, contacts, or recognition.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>FORMULATING A PLAN</h3>
                    <p>
                        We divided responsibilities by stages in the user’s journey. I was responsible for the strategy 
                        involving the COI virtual platform, and focused on how to keep users coming back for more, and 
                        becoming active participants in their communities. Healthy, productive communities are more likely 
                        to encourage active members, so I turned to Google’s research into what makes a good group dynamic. 
                        Using emails and newsletters, MnTech can encourage open communication and establish common communal 
                        norms. These newsletters can also be vehicles for news about upcoming events, community polls, member 
                        recognition and spotlights, and conversation starters. By including a recap of the month’s meetings, 
                        members that weren’t able to attend can also feel included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recognition can work as a reward and an incentive to perform certain tasks. Creating a framework 
                        for titles and roles benefits COIs twofold. Titles attached to roles - a moderator to manage 
                        intracommunity relations, a welcomer to make new members feel welcome, a secretary to take notes for 
                        the newsletters - not only give members a sense of ownership in their community, they also take work 
                        off of the stakeholder’s overloaded plate and encourage a self-sustaining community. Titles based on 
                        seniority - ie, number of meetings attended, weeks actively participating online, etc - encourage 
                        members to continue participating regularly, and signal to newer members who has the most experience 
                        in the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, by creating a title as a badge of honor, users may be encouraged to share their involvement with 
                        the COIs on their LinkedIn profiles, thereby creating another avenue of attracting new members.

                    <h3>STRATEGY PRESENTATION</h3>
                    <p>Our final and largest deliverable for MnTech was a video keynote presentation explaining our findings 
                        and strategy. We centered the approximately 7 minute long presentation on the experiences of a single 
                        representative user, following a “happy path” from coming across MnTech on social media through to 
                        becoming a long-term active member of a COI. We alternated short animated scenes of the user’s journey 
                        with quick explanations of the details and reasoning of each stage of our strategy, paired with 
                        screenshots of our prototypes. </p>

                    <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
                    <p>We identified opportunity gaps in MnTech’s website, membership onboarding, social media presence, and 
                        plan for utilizing their newest touchpoint, mobilize. We recommended a strategy that would involve:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>reorganizing their website to create easier navigation and discoverability</li>
                        <li>providing company points of contact with membership welcome packets for their employees</li>
                        <li>increasing their presence on current social media and expanding to youtube</li>
                        <li>utilizing newsletter templates to maintain contact with COI participants and encourage and inspire communication on the mobilize platform</li>
                        <li>incentives for active and sustained participation, and taking on leadership roles within the COIs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>There’s a good chunk of the app left to wireframe and add to the prototype. The most pressing is
                        to integrate the shopping list functions into the material list page, and then to flesh out the
                        remaining screens from the architecture diagram and and some in-between screens and things like
                        the settings screen. Once the app fully functions as a tool for an individual, I would like to
                        add framework for community and externalization - exporting project information to a printable
                        PDF, and sharing progress to social media.</p>
