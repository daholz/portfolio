                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>New users experience drop-off and decreased activity in the first few weeks of using Foodsby. Current
                    onboarding is not sufficiently preparing new users for how to use the service.</p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Teach new users about unusual Foodsby features, such as order cut-off times, rotating available
                    restaurants, limited restaurant order capacity, and picking up delivered food at a Foodsby kiosk.
                    Decrease time between first and second orders, increase frequency of ordering.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Invision, Sketch, Miro, Keynote, Google Survey, Google Sheets</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Stakeholder Interview, Competitor Analysis, User Journey Map, Feature Cards, Developer Consult, Dot

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <h3>MENTAL MODEL DISCONNECT FOR NEW USERS</h3>
                    <p>Foodsby noticed new users were taking a long time to place a second order, and ordered
                        infrequently until the value of the service would sink in. They were often confused by having to
                        order before a cut-off time - well before the projected delivery time, the rotating restaurant
                        options, and having to pick up items at the shared kiosk.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>FROM CONFUSED TO LOYAL</h3>
                    <p>Foodsby has many loyal, long-time users that appreciate the service’s format and value. The
                        question is, how to move users from “new” to “loyal, frequent customer” more quickly and
                        seamlessly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>DESIGNING FOR A DEVELOPMENT BUDGET</h3>
                    <p>We were given a development time budget of 4 - 5 weeks. I chose which features to development by
                        balancing user feedback, feature complexity and estimated time cost, and maximizing impact. In
                        the end I chose four features to recommend to the client for their current onboarding expansion,
                        and two larger projects as potential next steps.</p>

                    <p>The primary user of Foodsby is a busy office worker in a large building or complex. They don’t
                        have much time to travel, wait for food to be made, eat, and then get back to work. </p>

                    <h3>REMOTE WORKERS NEED REMOTE DELIVERY</h3>
                    <p>As workers navigate isolation during the pandemic, Foodsby has been looking into ways to continue
                        serving their users as they work from home.</p>

                    <p>I worked as a part of a large team during the feature ideation phase, creating 5 of many feature
                        cards. We consulted with a team of Foodsby developers about the timeline for creating each
                        feature, then dot voted on eleven features to include in a Kano Method survey. I analyzed the
                        data from this survey in a smaller group.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Part solo</h3>
                    <p>After analyzing the user research results, I worked independently to choose a set of features to
                        flesh out as high fidelity annotated wireframes. I created a feature proposal including these
                        annotated wireframes, and the user journey map that I made.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>

                    <h3>RESEARCH: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND USER JOURNEY MAP</h3>
                    <p>I began by investigating currently available project management apps and crafting apps in a
                        comparative analysis in order to evaluate existing solutions, and gain insight into common and
                        uncommon features. My scope included systems that were not geared towards crafts, apps that
                        targeted specific craft disciplines (quilting, knitting), and a couple of apps specifically
                        targeting cosplayers. I also included a printable PDF I found on a crafting blog.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>INITIAL CONCEPT DESIGN: FEATURE CARDS AND DOT VOTING</h3>
                    <p>We followed this up with brainstorming possible features that could bridge opportunity gaps, and
                        prototyping them as low-fidelity wireframes. These were made into feature cards. I created five
                        feature cards out of the few dozen we presented to a small team of Foodsby developers to gain
                        insight into an estimated timeframe for implementation for each feature.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>USER RESEARCH: KANO METHOD</h3>
                    <p>As a group, we used dot voting to select eleven features we wanted to present to users to gain
                        further insight into their desirability using the Kano method. Foodsby emailed our survey to 800
                        new users (signed up for less than 2 months). We had 10 responses, which we analyzed with both
                        discrete and continuous methods. I drew a graph with the results (above) to clearly visualize
                        which results were the most important and desirable to new users. Cross referencing this with
                        the development teams’ estimated time costs, I chose four features to expand into annotated high
                        fidelity wireframes and recommend to the Foodsby team in a feature proposal.</p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <h3>PROVIDE POSITIVE ALTERNATIVES,
                        INCENTIVIZE IMMEDIATE ACTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        Of the eleven features we included in the survey, I chose two features that were in the top
                        three “most important” results from the Kano analysis — a bar to represent how close the
                        restaurant is to selling out for the day, and a 5% discount on next-day orders. I combined this
                        second feature with one of my feature cards - a prompt to see tomorrow’s menus once it’s too
                        late to order for today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A common pain point for new users is that they’re used to ordering food right when they want it,
                        instead of needing to plan ahead. This gives them a positive action to take when they make a
                        mistake, and incentivizes them to act sooner rather than later.
                    </p>

                    <h3>CONSTRUCT A NEW MENTAL MODEL,

                        To more directly address onboarding, I also decided to include a slideshow that is shown to the

                        of the service new users are least likely to have an accurate mental model for.
