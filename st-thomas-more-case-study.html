                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>The client's Student Information System (SIS) is difficult for their staff to use - teachers avoid using it 
                    frequently, which leads to further difficultieswhen it comes time to turn in final grades.</p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Increase usability of the client’s Student Information System though improved learnability, hierarchy, 
                    and discoverability, in order to increase staff's efficient use of the program and their time, particularly 
                    during busy periods such as taking attendance or turning in end-of-period final grades.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Sketch, Invision, Google Sheets, Google Doc, Trello</p>

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <h3>RESORTING TO NOTEBOOKS</h3>
                    <p>The school’s SIS was hard for staff to use - difficult to navigate, difficult to learn, and difficult to remember how to use. 
                        Teachers often preferred to keep track of grades in analogue notebooks to minimize interactions with the SIS.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>CRUNCH TIME STRESS</h3>
                    <p>Submitting final grades at the end of the semester became a huge ordeal, creating and submitting grades for numerous assignments 
                        in a marathon. Many teachers turn to one teacher who’s considered the SME on the SIS for help understanding how to submit final grades, 
                        bogging down his workload even more.</p>

                    <h3>K - 8 TEACHERS</h3>
                    <p>Teachers from Kindergarten to 8th Grade need to use the SIS daily to log attendance during the hustle and bustle of the morning routine. 
                        They also need to record assignments, grades, track patterns in student attendance, and submit final grades.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>OFFICE ADMINISTRATORS</h3>
                    <p>Office administrators use the system to record tardy and absent students, and to follow up with teachers’ attendance records in order to call the 
                        families of missing students. They also use the SIS at the end of the semester to create report cards that go out to the students and their families.</p>

                    <h2>Role</h2>
                    <h3>TEAM RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>I worked as part of a team to conduct user research interviews. 
                        We developed our script and plan as a team. I moderated one remote 
                        contextual interview, and took notes as an observer during the other 
                        sessions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>SOLO TASKS</h3>
                    <p>I worked alone to do a cognitive walkthrough during the research phase. 
                        After the user interviews and discussing results as a group, I worked 
                        alone to ideate solutions, make low and high fidelity wireframes and 
                        storyboards, and create an interactive prototype tour.</p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>FINAL DELIVERABLES</h3>
                    <p>We did a cognitive walkthrough to quickly familiarize ourselves with the 
                        SIS, and see how the platform looks to a new user. We conducted 
                        contextual inquiries to broaden our understanding and get an regular 
                        user's perspective. Ultimately I created an interactive prototype tour 
                        to give the client a taste of what implemented solutions could look like 
                        in context, and explain some of the design reasoning.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>COGNITIVE WALKTHROUGH</h3>
                    <p>The first step in analyzing St Thomas More’s SIS was doing a cognitive 
                        walkthrough. We had limited access to the system itself, so we used 
                        videos (sans sounds/narration) and screenshots provided by the school 
                        for this purpose. The cognitive walkthrough centered on the five most 
                        common tasks completed by the staff on the SIS platform. Our four main 
                        parameters for judging the platform were how it measures up to mental 
                        models, visibility/hierarchy, consistency/mapping, and feedback. </p>
                    <p>After conducting the cognitive walkthrough, I developed a hypothesis that 
                        the users we would be interviewing will have had issues with learnability, 
                        discoverability, and easily navigating pages due to poor hierarchy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>REMOTE CONTEXTUAL INQUIRIES</h3>
                    <p>We had the opportunity to direct 45 minute to 1 hour long contextual 
                        inquiry sessions with four staff members who were familiar with the 
                        platform - one administrator, and three teachers. I moderated one session, 
                        and observed the other three. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, 
                        we conducted these contextual inquiries remotely.</p>
                    <p>These sessions confirmed my hypothesis - the staff had no formal training 
                        using the program, and had to rely on the program’s own learnability and 
                        questioning their peers. As a result, there were quite a few things that 
                        no one, or only a few people, knew - for example, what all of the 
                        abbreviations used in the attendance spreadsheet stood for.</p>
                    <p>It also helped to highlight the priorities of the staff, what their 
                        environments were like during attendance-taking, work-arounds they 
                        developed to make the system work for them, and specific pain points. 
                        For example, the person I interviewed acted as SME for the platform, and 
                        he was often pulled away to help answer questions at the end of the 
                        semester when he was busy finalizing his own grades and helping the 
                        office get the report cards in order.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>IDEATING AND PROTOTYPING</h3>
                    <p>I synthesized the findings from my cognitive walkthrough and the contextual 
                        inquiry sessions into a research findings & recommendations report. 
                        The highest priority change needed to be a way to bridge that learnability 
                        gap. Given a limited ability to change the platform itself, devising a 
                        quick and easy to access training resource seemed like the best route. </p>
                    <p>A couple of the research sessions revealed that the platform had walkthrough 
                        videos, and scheduled training sessions that the teachers didn’t have the 
                        time to leverage. All three of the teachers also supplemented the platform 
                        with their own handwritten notes - either tracking grades in physical 
                        notebooks, or printing out sheets to write on. I therefore opted to make 
                        a five sheet paper user guide, with a PDF version that could be printed 
                        if the original copy was lost.</p>
                    <p>I also made a prototype of the teachers’ dashboard page with easy, 
                        feasible changes: reorganizing the widgets, updating the icons to be 
                        more indicative of their purpose, and increasing the size of the text 
                        and icons for accessibility.</p>

                    <h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
                    <p>I would have loved to have more time to work on this project. I initially 
                        planned to redesign the gradebook and attendance pages, but there simply 
                        wasn’t enough time. </p>
                    <p>I prioritized the paper guide as a quick, cheap, and easy to implement 
                        solution over redesigning the software. If I could continue this project,
                         I would address the hierarchy and visual design of those pages first.</p>
