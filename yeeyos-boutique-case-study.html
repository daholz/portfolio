                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Yeeyo's Boutique has a physical store, but no online presence and no branding. With the Covid-19 Pandemic making in person interaction dangerous, my client needed a strategy for expanding their enterprise online.</p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Create an ecommerce and contactless pickup strategy that works for a business with minimal staff (1 - 3 people), design branding and a logo.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Figma, Invision, Trello, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Miro</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Competitive analysis, contextual interview, directed storytelling, feature cards, wireframes, personas, storyboards, journey map, site map, interactive prototype, usability tests</p>

                    <h3>E-COMMERCE AND ONLINE PRESENCE</h3>
                    <p>With Covid-19 creating a retail environment defined by danger and uncertainty, Yeeyo’s Boutique needed to move up their plans to expand online. They wanted an e-commerce website that could accommodate established customers, and reach new customers. As a business largely run by one person, we also needed to find an easy way for them to accurately keep track of inventory to make an online business feasible.

                    <br>
                    <h3>CONTACTLESS PICKUP</h3>
                    <p>Our client also wanted to find a way to safely integrate contactless pickup into their physical space. Their location in a busy, crowded mall with limited signage introduced further complications to this goal.</p>

                    <h3>SOMALI AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES</h3>
                    <p>Yeeyo’s Boutique currently serves Minnesota’s Somali and Muslim communities from their location in South Minneapolis. Customers are familiar with the shop owner, and often ask for her recommendations while they are shopping. The small shop is cozy and friendly, and the owner’s family often help her during busy periods.

                        Our test participants, sourced by our client, were excited to shop online and already were frequent users of grocery delivery apps and online shopping for everyday necessities and gifts</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>DISCOVERY RESEARCH + Stakeholder Interview</h3>
                    <p>We began the project with a stakeholder interview, and then conducted a competitive analysis of online stores selling similar goods. We examined them for a variety of e-commerce features, methods of communicating with customers, website layouts, and UI elements, and documented our findings in a spreadsheet. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>FEATURE CARDS AND USER RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>Our next step was to create wireframes of features we wanted to include in the website. We used dot voting to determine a set of feature cards that we could fit into a one hour interview with test participants to help spark conversations around e-commerce experiences, and to get direct feedback on specific features. We uncovered several useful nuggets of information that contributed to how we determined which e-commerce platform would be the most useful to our client. For example, being able to use Apple or Google Pay was very important to our users, which completely eliminated one of our otherwise top contenders.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>CONTEXTUAL INTERVIEW</h3>
                    <p>I visited the physical shop in the 24 Mall with one of my team members. We discovered that the mall is very difficult for first time visitors to navigate, with minimal signs and busy, tight hallways. At the shop we got to speak with the shop owner and one of her children, and spoke with them about their experiences selling with customers and how they used the space. We gleaned more useful information that also informed our web platform selection. They had just begun using Square to process sales, and the platform we ultimately selected could update its online inventory to reflect sales made in the store using Square.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>PERSONA, USER JOURNEY MAP, AND SCREEN FLOW</h3>
                    <p>After interviewing users, customers and staff alike, we did a comparative analysis of e-commerce platforms and selected one that most closely aligned with our priorities - Square-inventory integration, multiple payment options, and a highly customizable builder. One of my teammates created a style sheet with colors, fonts, and a logo that reflected the tone of the shop. Meanwhile, I created a map of the site’s architecture reflecting the needs of our users and the capabilities of our chosen platform. I then used Figma to build out wireframes and create an interactive prototype. To fit our timeline, I prototyped the pages following a happy path from landing on the home page to adding an item to your cart. I included pages a new user would find useful, such as the about and contact pages.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>CONTACTLESS PICKUP</h3>
                    <p>My desk research on contactless pickup methods revealed that curbside pickup was the most popular option - unfortunately, this would not suit our client, as she was often the only one in the shop, and couldn’t guarantee that a second person would be present at any moment to leave the shop supervised. Our solution was to create a dedicated space for storing items for pickup, using a cart with a sign. We also knew finding the shop itself would likely be a problem for new users, so we created a design for an A-frame sign to sit outside the shop, and a simple map of the mall to include in the email telling users that their order is ready for pickup.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>DESIGN EVALUATION AND ADJUSTMENTS</h3>
                    <p>Our final stage of the project was to test the website prototype and contactless pickup storyboard with users. I ended up changing which template the website would use to accommodate user feedback about the product page layout and usability. Our final handoff to the client included a set of annotated wireframes from the updated prototype.</p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
                    <p>The usability test results were largely positive. Users were able to easily complete the tasks,
                        and found navigation intuitive. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>STRUGGLE WITH MICROCOPY</h3>
                    <p>The one notable exception is some struggle with the title for the “Elements” section. I tested a
                        few different words, and none quite fit the bill. 2/3 test participants weren’t immediately sure
                        what that section meant, but all were able to eventually figure it out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>There’s a good chunk of the app left to wireframe and add to the prototype. The most pressing is
                        to integrate the shopping list functions into the material list page, and then to flesh out the
                        remaining screens from the architecture diagram and and some in-between screens and things like
                        the settings screen. Once the app fully functions as a tool for an individual, I would like to
                        add framework for community and externalization - exporting project information to a printable
                        PDF, and sharing progress to social media.</p>
